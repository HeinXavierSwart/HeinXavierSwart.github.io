# HeinXavierSwart.github.io

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal static webpage, hosted via GitHub Pages. This project utilizes Python with Flask to serve dynamic web content, which is then converted to static pages using Flask-Freeze to be compatible with GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Flask**: Backend logic and web server. Utilized Flask-Freeze to convert the Flask app into a static website suitable for hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
- **HTML & CSS Templates**: Frontend structure and styling located in the `app/templates` and `app/static` directories respectively.
- **Pipenv**: For Python virtual environment management and dependency resolution.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistent execution across environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline. Any commits pushed to the `main` branch are tested and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, refreshing the live GitHub Pages site.

## Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the directory layout:

.
├── app
│ ├── build # Static files generated by Flask-Freeze
│ ├── static # Static assets: images, CSS, JavaScript
│ └── templates # HTML templates
├── Dockerfile # Docker configuration file
├── freeze.py # Flask-Freeze configuration
├── Pipfile & Pipfile.lock # Pipenv configuration and locked dependencies
└── run.py # Application entry point


## Local Development

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Pipenv

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [Your Repository URL]
   cd [Your Repository Name]
   
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment (using Pipenv):**
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell

3. **Generate Static Pages using Flask-Freeze:**    
    ```bash
    python freeze.py

4. **Run with Docker:**
  - Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t [your-image-name] .
   ```
  - Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 [your-image-name]
    ```
    
5. **Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to view the app.**

## Deployment

The site is hosted using the default [username].github.io domain provided by GitHub Pages. Commits pushed to the main branch trigger GitHub Actions to test and subsequently deploy to the gh-pages branch, updating the live site.
